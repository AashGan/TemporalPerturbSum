# Does SpatioTemporal information benefit Two video summarization benchmarks?

This is the repository for this project on the analysis as to whether video summarization datasets are affected greatly by temporal perturbations and the performance temporally invariant models achieve. It contains the code for each of the experiments, the configurations behind each experiment, as some code to read the results, analyse them and generate some of the plots given in the paper.

# Weights and replication

To retrieve the exact results made from the paper, the weights are not given with the repository, please contact Aashutosh.ganesh@maastrichtuniversity.nl for the specific weights for replication.
